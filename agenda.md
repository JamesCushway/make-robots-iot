## Purpose of the day

We're going to be learning how to programatically control a Sphero robot using a Raspberry Pi, and how to connect it to the internet to upgrade it into a real IoT device. It's a fact that people learn best when doing things together. So we'll split into teams during the day and play with our robots in groups.

At the end of the day we'll all talk about what and how we learned. You should be able to answer these two questions in that discussion:

1.  What did you and your team mate/s do and what did you learn?
2.  How did the Make Day contribute towards you learning, and what can we improve?
